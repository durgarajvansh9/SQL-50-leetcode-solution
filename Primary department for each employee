Approach
Select employee_id, department_id of all those employees whose is in only one department:
SELECT employee_id, department_id
FROM Employee
GROUP BY employee_id
HAVING count(employee_id) = 1

Then select employee_id, department_id of all those employee whose primary_flag is 'Y' by:
SELECT employee_id,department_id
FROM Employee
WHERE primary_flag = 'Y'

Now join both solution using UNION.

Code
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT employee_id, department_id
FROM Employee
GROUP BY employee_id
HAVING count(employee_id) = 1
UNION 
SELECT employee_id,department_id
FROM Employee
WHERE primary_flag = 'Y'

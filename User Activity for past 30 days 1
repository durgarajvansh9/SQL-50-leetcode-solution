Approach
Looking at the result table we write the basic select statement:
SELECT ____ as day, ____ as active_users FROM Activity
Now we get days by selecting different activity date and active_users by counting distinct user_id's that were active on that day:
SELECT distinct activity_date as day, count(distinct user_id) as active_users FROM Activity

Now as per question we'll have to specify date upto which we want to calculate users:
WHERE activity_date> "2019-06-27" and activity_date<= "2019-07-27"

Now finally to have one activity_date only once in the result table: Group by activity_date

Thus the final code becomes
SELECT distinct activity_date as day, count(distinct user_id) as active_users
FROM Activity
WHERE activity_date> "2019-06-27" and activity_date<= "2019-07-27"
GROUP BY activity_date

Code
SELECT distinct activity_date as day, count(distinct user_id) as active_users
FROM Activity 
WHERE activity_date> "2019-06-27" and activity_date<= "2019-07-27"
GROUP BY activity_date

A beginner friendly answer is written by following basic concepts step by step.

Approach
Looking at the result table we write the basic select statement
SELECT project_id, ____ as average_years FROM ___

AS average_price should be rounded to 2 decimal places
SELECT project_id, round(_____,2) as average_years

Now as evident from Explanation given, the experience and project_id, required to calculate average_years are from different tables hence we need to join these tables (as emplyoyee_id is common in these two tables we join on employee_id)
SELECT project_id, round(_____,2) as average_years
FROM Projects p left JOIN Employee as e
ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id

Now to calculate average_years, we need to add experience of all the employee (of that particulat project_id) and then divide it by the count of all project_id
This is formulated as:sum(experience_years)

Now to calculate no. of pople in each project we must count the employees with same project_id by :count(project_id)

now count() function with the GROUP BY clause is used to count the data which were grouped on a project_id attribute of the table as:
Group by proJECTt_id

Thus the final code becomes:
Select project_id, round(sum(experience_years)/count(project_id)2,) as average_years
from Project as p
left join Employee as e
On p.employee_id = e.employee_id
Group by project_id

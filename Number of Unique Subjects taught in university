Looking at the result table we write the basic select statement
SELECT teacher_id, ____ as cnt FROM Teacher

Now we have to find the number of unique subjects each teacher teaches in the university, we can do it by finding the number of distinct subject_id's in the table.
select teacher_id,count(distinct subject_id) as cnt

Now we have to count the how many unique subject_id's are there
select teacher_id,count(distinct subject_id) as cnt
from Teacher

Now finally to have one teacher_id only once in the Teacher table we: Group by teacher_id

Thus the final code becomes
select teacher_id,count(distinct subject_id) as cnt
from Teacher
group by teacher_id
Solution:
select teacher_id,count(distinct subject_id) as cnt
from Teacher
group by teacher_id
